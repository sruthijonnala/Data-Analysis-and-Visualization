Analysis on Social Buzz

#Client’s Name: Social Buzz

Client’s Industry: Social media & Content creation

Client’s Background: Social Buzz, a rapidly expanding social media organization, has garnered an impressive user base of over 500 million active users per month in just 5 years. They’ve outpaced their growth projections and are seeking the guidance of an advisory firm to efficiently manage their scaling process.

Business problem: The client has reached a massive scale within recent years and does not have the resources internally to handle it.

Throughout this experience, I have applied my data analytics skills to:

Data Cleaning and Modeling: I proficiently cleaned and conducted data modeling on the client’s datasets using MySQL Workbench, ensuring data accuracy and integrity.

Data Analysis: I carried out a comprehensive analysis of the client’s data to identify the top 5 content categories with the highest aggregate popularity.

Data Visualization: Leveraging Microsoft Excel, I created engaging data visualizations that effectively represented key insights derived from the analysis.

Storytelling with Data: I adeptly conveyed the narrative within the data by using the visualizations to present meaningful insights.

Presentation: I prepared a compelling presentation for the client using Microsoft PowerPoint, highlighting and sharing valuable insights extracted from the data analysis.

Data Cleaning and Data Modeling :

Throughout the data cleaning process, I meticulously attended to various aspects of the datasets, performing all operations in MySQL Workbench.

Data cleaning was done separately and starting with the removal of blank entries to ensure data integrity. Subsequently, spelling errors were corrected to enhance data quality and maintain consistency. Unnecessary columns were removed to keep only the most important data. I also changed the column names to make the data easier to understand.
